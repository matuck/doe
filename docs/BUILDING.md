## Encoders (optional)

I personally want my endoders to run more smoothly.  This is an optional step but will make the encoders easy to turn.  I modify my encoders to remove the detents.  This is relatively simple.  This is the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYPsISzesLs) I followed to modify my encoders.  You can skip to 3:30 of the video, before that it is desoldering an encoder from a board.
