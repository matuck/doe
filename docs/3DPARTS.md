# 3D Parts

The housing or shell of keyboard is 3D printed parts.  Dactyl keyboards can be generated in a number of ways.  I used the [Cosmos Beta](https://ryanis.cool/cosmos-beta) to generate mine.  I downloaded all the files initially including the step file.  The models would work as is but I wanted to add an external reset switch and a toggle switch for power.  So I took the step files, imported them into OnShape.  I then added the additional holes necessary.  Then exported to new stl files for the new models.

## Using the models

If you do not have a 3D printer, you can use a printing service.  In my case I printed my parts.  This is a time consuming process.  The main pieces take like half a day each to print.  After they are done printing there is quite a bit of post printing work to be done to them.  You have to remove the supports.  To do this I use a small pair of needle node pliers, my small cutters, and a hobby knife.  If you are using the amoeba king PCB's, I recommend to take one of them after the supports are cleared and making sure it sets in the keyboard shell.  You may have to do a little more clenaing up of the shell.  The PCB's will fit snuggly into place.


## Preping the case 

Test fit your pieces.  Make sure your OLED's fit where they are suppose to.  Also make sure your encoders fit.  In my case I had to make the encoder shaft hole a touch larger.  I also had to trim some of the area that holds the encoder to get it to sit all the way in.

### Insert your M3 thread inserts

Heat your soldering iron 50 to 100 degress hotter than what you printed your case pieces at.  I recommed to have a cone tip point for this.  Take one of your inserts and and set it into place give it a light push so that it sticks In place.  Now take your soldering iron and put the tip inside the insert letting it heat up.  Genetly and slowly push the insert in until it is flush with the rest of the plastic.  The slower the plastic heats and cools around the insert the strong the bond will be.  Repeat this process till all of your inserts are in

That is it for the case prep.
